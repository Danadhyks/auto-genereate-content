Automatic Video Generation from Python
This project demonstrates how to generate a video automatically using Python. It utilizes the OpenAI API for text generation and image generation to create a video based on a given prompt or description.

Installation
Before running the code, make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests opencv-python
You will also need an API key from OpenAI for both text and image generation. Replace chatgpt_api_key and dalle_api_key variables in the code with your own API keys.

Usage
Run the Python script generate_video.py.
Enter the story or description when prompted.
The script will then translate the text to English (if necessary), generate images based on the text using the OpenAI DALL-E model, and finally create a video from the generated images.
